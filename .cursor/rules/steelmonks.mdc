We are working on Shopify's Dawn theme with Tailwind. The project uses Tailwind, as the name implies.

** Make sure you prefix all tailwind classes with 'twcss-' as per the config below, except for responsive classes. Responsive layout classes are prefixed at the property instead, such as 'md:twcss-bg-black' **

Always refer to the tailwind config and the README file for conventions.
